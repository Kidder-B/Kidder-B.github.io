				<h2>Smarter</h2>
				<p>Good education. In order to obtain statehood, New Mexico established a public education system. Free and
					accessible education makes democracy work for all. Athena has been a local educator, student, and parent. But,
					she also has experience in other states and systems.

					When her oldest son, Anthony, was in 3rd grade, in Florida, she discovered his class was not learning math.
					Working with other parent volunteers, school administration, and an existing math curriculum, she led the Math
					Superstars program, school-wide, for 1st-5th grades during his last two years at the school.

					Our schools need to be the best they can be and everyone needs to be a “forever learner.” We have to make sure
					all our students seek to attain their maximum potential AND offer that opportunity. Athena will bring
					educators, parents, and students together for a smarter New Mexico</p>

				<h2>Safer</h2>
				<p>Now and into the 22nd Century. Common sense gun laws protect everyone’s rights to life, liberty and the
					pursuit of happiness. We all want to feel safe in our communities. But what about the future?
					NM laid the groundwork with the Energy Transition Act in 2019 for part of the solution. It engaged community,
					utilities, and others to enact a planned reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions across the state from
					electric generation.

					But we need to MAKE it happen and MANDATE more. Athena will bring her engineering mindset and mom’s
					determination to the senate floor for a safer New Mexico.</p>

				<h2>Stronger</h2>
				<p>Diverse economy. Athena will take her experiences as a small business owner, start-up entrepreneur, and tech
					transfer expert to foster collaboration. She knows we have all the ingredients for a diverse economy: three
					National Labs, three top universities, and outstanding regional career technical learning centers to develop
					burgeoning industries.

					NM has the opportunity to be the hub of “Green-shoring.” Does our eager new generation see the opportunities?
					Athena will keep us focused on people, planet, and profit….for ALL.</p>

	<section class="about">
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Retired U.S. Navy engineer, a scientist, a technology entrepreneur. She has been an advocate for clean energy to
			take us safely into the 22nd century for over a decade, now. She is also a community member, mother, grandmother
			and wife. All of these experiences have shaped her life and helped her understand that the next chapter of her
			life should be in public service.

			Clean energy economy advocate. Athena is currently taking her experiences as an energy engineer, Community Solar
			coach for DOE, and past president of the New Mexico Solar Energy Association to shape next year’s legislation to
			bring Community Solar to NM. Opportunities for economic development include project development, construction,
			investment, and subscriber companies.

			Community, family, and faith. Balancing her work and advocacy with raising three sons in a multigenerational
			household was always challenging. When COVID-19 became evident and measures for defeating it were issued, she
			acted. She immediately designed a no-sew mask, set new rules for visiting her 91 year-old mother, and began
			following the data and seeking reliable information. She knows that while we may be inconvenienced now, we will
			all appreciate everyone’s efforts in the future when we can once again be more physically connected. For more,
			visit her Ballotpedia page.</p>
